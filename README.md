# Swagger_2.0
Welcome to my curated collection of **Swagger (OpenAPI 2.0)** files, representing a wide range of real-time APIs I have designed and developed over the past **3 years**. Each Swagger spec file corresponds to an enterprise-grade backend system integration or microservice, covering diverse domains and operations.
This repository serves as a centralized collection of Swagger (OpenAPI Specification 2.0) definitions that I’ve developed for various backend systems. These API specifications are designed following industry best practices and are widely adopted by enterprise applications for seamless integration, consistency, and maintainability.

📝 Each folder corresponds to a real-time project or backend system with its own Swagger (OAS 2.0) file.
